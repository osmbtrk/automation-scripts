Please do not replace any old data.

Note:
A. You may need to find and copy-paste the number of apps (Difficulty) from the app tweak exported GS data. https://prnt.sc/3CAb6SiABBmt ; https://prnt.sc/bGtg69d70-bs.

-> Rank - Put the current date (the date you run this bot)
-> Movement - Make it one week movement from the last 7 days
