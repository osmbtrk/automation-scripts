The goal is just for google to be able to crawl our app in google play through keyword
----------------
The other ASO bot will provide targeted keyword in this sheet (Content Request Sheet):
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zZj4i3mTkWTzWB0E4JVe1nKjZDwgO1L4a1O45BkmcpQ/edit#gid=1109673203
then you will take the keywords for the long description in the content sheet.
-----------------

Steps for BOT instruction:

*Move the keywords from 'Keyword Analysis' Gsheet to 'Content Request' Gsheet*

1. Go to the 'Keyword Analysis' Gsheet, and just simply pay attention to sheet "LD" (Long Description). 
- Copy Paste all the targeted keywords to the 'content request' Gsheet - LD Sheet. https://prnt.sc/3aAvf-5k5i4D.
- Check the data in colomn K&L in the 'Keyword Analysis' Gsheet and write it into colomn L in the 'Content Request Sheet'. https://prnt.sc/pL_ks48-iKNz; https://prnt.sc/AYXSatOoR9Jx
(note, there are three type of meta data : Title, Short Desc., Long Desc.). In the first Gsheet LD are separated but in the second Gsheet it is are combined into one.

2. Paste all the targeted keywords and data into the right colomn into the 'Content Request' Gsheet . https://prnt.sc/1tTEM37Bfa6e. 
Also ensure the meta data are put in place in one colomn, L. https://prnt.sc/v1jrrKXi19zB

Further explanation :
In content request :
--Colomn A:E - Copy paste from kw analysis to content request  (colomn D formula shall be same)
--Colomn F:G & I & J & N:P- Drag down the formula
--Colomn H - Copy paste 'value' from kw analysis to content request  
Colomn L - Check and refer in the kw analysis colomn K:L, if it was sent either to Title or SD or LD
-Colomn AC:AD - Copy paste the category (per country) in colomn C, then remove duplicate.
--Colomn K & R:AA - Ignore


*Put the keywords in the Long Description*

For Colomn AE, you need to fill in the targeted keyword instructed in colomn N:P

3. Go to 'Content Request Sheet' LD Sheet, colomn AE, then ensure all the targeted keywords is filled in at least 1.
(but please check note below for the quality) for all the countries (>10-20 countries).

4. In colomn L, check for the ones stated as 'Send for Title and SD'. Then, refers, check and copy 
the keywords in colomn D, and paste it into colomn AE Long description https://prnt.sc/g1lwVQNxnxTL,
at "First 100 words" & "Included in first sentence on the paragraphs" (Before first dot). Goal is for title and SD keywords
to be placed accordingly so google will predict those keywords for our app.

5. Then check and ensure in colomn O & P, if the relevant keyword 'Title and SD', are 
more than >0 (at least 1). If it is still not more than 1, then check colomn E,
then copy the keyword and paste it into colomn AO according to the previous step's instruction until colomn
O & P are more than >0 (at least 1).

6. Then check in colomn H, find the keywords which has target of 1 or more and the keywords noted as Title, SD, and LD.
Then, check in colomn N ("Long Desc.Repetition") and ensure those keywords are placed more than 1 in colomn AO. 
Because those keywords needs repetition. So put the keywords neatly and attractively somehow, anyway or anyhow as you can do.

Note :
a. Ensure for every country's LD (Long Description), the very begining of the sentence is [Travpart is ...]
b. Ensure the LD has as many bulet points as possible, hence; the explanation are clear.

d. If you can make the whole Long description (both local and english) to be gramartically correct that's better than not. 
e. Check density in colomn J, For title and SD it should be >1,5% and for LD should be >1%.
